Automated Fault Detection System for Production Lines

Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an automated fault detection system for production lines using Raspberry Pi and Machine Learning. By combining affordable hardware with modern technology, this system captures images of products, trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and detects defects automatically. It is an accessible solution for small and medium-sized enterprises looking to enhance quality control processes.

Features

Cost-Effective: Uses affordable components like Raspberry Pi and open-source libraries.

Automated Quality Assurance: Simplifies defect detection in production lines.

Customizable: Easily adaptable for various products and defect types.

Scalable: Seamlessly integrates with existing production systems.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
